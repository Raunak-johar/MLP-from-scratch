# MLP-from-scratch
This is an implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron using NumPy library.The network predicts price of the houses in Boston depending upon 13 different attributes.The Boston house-prices dataset can be imported from scikit-learn library.

# Usage
Download and run similar to a usual ".py" script

# Problems faced
The dataset used is an inbuilt dataset retrieved from "sklearn" library and consists of only 506 samples in total.So there is a possibily for overfitting on training samples by the model, which needs to be taken care of.
